IN THIS APPLICATION WE HAVE TWO TEXT FIELDS,
WHEN WE ENTER DATA IN THE TEXTFIELD AND CLICK ON SUBMIT BUTTON,
THE DATA GETS SAVED IN A json FILE WHICH IS STORED IN THE LOCATION,
storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.testjsonapp/files/form_data.json
WE CAN ALSO SEE THE DATA IN FORM OF LazyColumn JUST BELOW THE SUBMIT BUTTON.
